### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- common/
|- constant/
|- helper/
|- modules/
|- routs/
|- services/
|- theme/
|- utility/
|- main.dart
|- firebase_options.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
- common - Contains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button, TextField etc.
- constant - Contains the constant widgets for your applications. For assets, colors, dimens, constant_values, enums, styles etc.
- helper - Contains the helper for your application. For database_helper (database query, synonyms, database error message, database response model).
         - Contains the helper for your application. For storage_handler (store data local (Get Storage) query, storage getter setter methods, synonyms).
         - Contains the exeptions handler your application. For custom_exeptions_handler (exeptions message ex. No internet connection available, etc.) exeptions throw.
- modules - Contains the modules your application. For your application all modules flow ( Model-View-Controller (MVC)) is one widely used architectural pattern.
- routes.dart - This file contains all the routes for your application.
- services - Contains the services your application. For your application language translation key value etc.
- theme - Contains the theme of your app. For Your application theme (Color, style, ) etc.
- utility - Contains the utility of your app. For Your application role permission, Common ( widget, values, string, log, progress, method, functions) etc.
